UPDATED checklist:


p5: 

make separate sktches with the 5 energies (space and ratna are basically already there)
- once locations gathered/decided, 








ignore the rest of this...









====================================
=================

P5:

emotions:
pride, shame, Anger

for each emotion:
    separate component and sketch linked to the onClick rendered in app
        - this involves the react p5 wrapper
    consider: how to write iNTENSITY functions as it relates to duration
        - color mapping
    make loose vector to surround image / ie sets function of where they stop?? ask Ross
        - consider: "liquid" for body vector to slow down/speed up boid movemet?


===================

REACT:

- p5 wrapper:

- how the page will render: 
    breakdown:
    intro and instructions stay -> dropdown menu for each selection 
    

swap them out with the router - dropdown w onClick (when selection changes, redirect to different route)
- function to render scripts all together 
libraries that are required by all the scripts -- link tags in the head of that html that will
be happy to live in the standard head 

focus: first component for first rendering

ignore the rest of this...









====================================
databasing:

1. users
2. organizations
3. enter date 
4. 1 sensation: intensity scale and click points on the body
5. app.test.js has nothing in it!
6. index.js has nothing in it!

stretch goals:
 - 4 sensations
 - entry for during or post-meditation


















===============================

project checklist (original plan)

1. neutral body template 
2. D3 pr P5 library .... WebGL?
3. wireframes for app selector 
4. routes for each emotion from homepage // server.js
_________________________


MVP:
