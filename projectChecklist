UPDATED checklist:
=================

final few days: goals

add other components/emotions? maybe 4 more?


clearing energy of white -- done
mystery/unknown as black? --done
lavendar nostalgia -- done
light blue vulnerability  -- done













=========================
P5:

emotions:
pride, shame, sadness, disgust

for each emotion:
 - link each component to the onClick rendered in app

 - ross: not much luck rendering multiple particle systems, halp?
        


===================

REACT:

- timer?

uh oh Ross I took these notes and can't make  sense of them: 

swap them out with the router - dropdown w onClick (when selection changes, redirect to different route)
- function to render scripts all together 
libraries that are required by all the scripts -- link tags in the head of that html that will
be happy to live in the standard head 

focus: first component for first rendering


============
ignore the rest of this...
============

 p5:
    consider: how to write iNTENSITY functions as it relates to duration
        - color mapping
    make loose vector to surround image / ie sets function of where they stop?? ask Ross
        - consider: "liquid" for body vector to slow down/speed up boid movemet?


React:
- p5 wrapper:

- how the page will render: 
    breakdown:
    intro and instructions stay -> dropdown menu for each selection 






====================================
databasing:

1. users
2. organizations
3. enter date 
4. 1 sensation: intensity scale and click points on the body
5. app.test.js has nothing in it!
6. index.js has nothing in it!

stretch goals:
 - 4 sensations
 - entry for during or post-meditation


















===============================

project checklist (original plan)

1. neutral body template 
2. D3 pr P5 library .... WebGL?
3. wireframes for app selector 
4. routes for each emotion from homepage // server.js
_________________________
