# Processing Emotions
### AKA Emotional Mapping v1

https://emotional-mapping-vr.herokuapp.com/

The intention of this project was to build a visualisation resource for those who are new to working with mindfulness and body-centered practices. By having an animated version of an emotion projected on the body, someone new to these practices could begin to imagine and/or explore how feelings and sensations move throughout their body.

"Processing Emotions" is the first version of a personal project build during bootcamp at Enspiral Dev Academy. At the time of this build, I'd been coding for less than two months. We were given <1 week of concentrated time to complete this project, with limited help from teachers or peers.

This project utilises the p5 animation library, the Skeleton styling framework, and Reactjs. 

Build by Theta Likins, April 2018.

## User Stories

### MVP

As a user:
* I want to be given context as to how and where emotions are likely to manifest in the body.
* I want to be able to see animated visualisations of these different feelings and where they often exist in the body.
* I want to be able to be able to meditate along with the visualisation and contemplate my own embodied experience of the feeling in question

### Stretch

As a user:
* I want each visualisation to be specified by time, reach, and opacity to best illustrate its movement through the body
