UPDATED checklist:


what I need to figure out:


- emotion-specific animations: prepping for each that is accomplishable (if one, which?)

-p5: switch out flock for particle system

    - consider: "liquid" for body vector to slow down/speed up boid movemet?

- adding/exploring further styling to test rendering components 

- binding my eventual p5 to the components
    breakdown:
    intro and instructions stay -> dropdown menu for each selection 
    animation rules for each of the emotions -- maybe a different color but same trajectory?
    


ignore the rest of this...


databasing:

1. users
2. organizations
3. enter date 
4. 1 sensation: intensity scale and click points on the body
5. app.test.js has nothing in it!
6. index.js has nothing in it!

stretch goals:
 - 4 sensations
 - entry for during or post-meditation


















===============================

project checklist (original plan)

1. neutral body template 
2. D3 pr P5 library .... WebGL?
3. wireframes for app selector 
4. routes for each emotion from homepage // server.js
_________________________


MVP:
2 main pages:

3rd page: neutral body  {{template}}
    emotional iterations:
    Anger, Pride, Shame, ... love.... Fear, Happiness, Sadness
